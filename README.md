# settin-up

 This repo is used to set up my Mac. Ideally this should be run in [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)

## Easy as 1... 2... 3. That's how easy!

If you are not Devxiongmao (Jon Psaila), be sure to update the system-setup.sh file with your git config information.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devxiongmao/settin-up.git
cd settin-up
./system-setup.sh
```

## Once the script is run....
1. Open iTerm2. You should be greeted with the setup wizard from powerlevel10k
2. Follow the setup wizard to customize your terminal
3. If the setup wizard doesn't appear, run `p10k configure`
